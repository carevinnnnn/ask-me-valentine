# Valentine's Chat Card Website 💝

## Overview
A cute pastel-themed chat interface where "Mark" asks "Madhel" to be his Valentine. The chat mimics a messaging app with a playful twist — if she clicks "No," the bot keeps convincing her until "Yes" is the only option!

## Page 1: The Chat Experience
- **Cute pastel design** — soft pinks, purples, lavender background with rounded bubbly chat UI
- Chat opens with a message from **Mark**: *"Hey Madhel, do you want to be my Valentine? 💕"*
- Two buttons appear: **Yes** and **No**

### The 4 Rounds of "No" Convincing:
1. **Round 1** — Bot replies with a sweet convincing message. "No" button shrinks slightly
2. **Round 2** — Another convincing message. "No" button gets smaller and starts drifting to a random position
3. **Round 3** — More convincing! "No" becomes tiny and moves around erratically when hovered
4. **Round 4** — "No" button disappears completely. Only a giant **YES** button remains

Each round shows a new chat bubble with playful/funny messages like:
- "Are you sure? 🥺"
- "Think again... I'll bring chocolates 🍫"
- "Come onnn, you know you want to! 💗"
- Final: "There's only one right answer here 😏"
